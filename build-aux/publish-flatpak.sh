#   build-aux/publish-flatpak.sh             build this machine's architecture
#                                            into .flatpak-repo, nothing else
#   build-aux/publish-flatpak.sh --site DIR  sign .flatpak-repo and write DIR
#                                            as the static site that serves it
#
# The two halves are separate because CI builds each architecture on its own
# runner, one after the other into the same repository, and only then signs:
# the key is needed once, in the one job that publishes, instead of on every
# machine that compiles. The site is what GitHub Pages serves. It is laid out
# afresh on every publish, since Pages replaces the whole site anyway; a
# client then fetches the new commit whole instead of as a delta against the
# old one, which for one binary costs next to nothing.
#
# --site reads from the environment:
#   FLATPAK_REPO_URL     where DIR/repo will be reachable over HTTP      (required)
#   FLATPAK_GPG_ID       fingerprint or uid of the signing key           (required)
#   FLATPAK_GPG_KEY_B64  base64 of that key exported with --export-secret-keys,
#                        for CI; omit it to sign with the local keyring
#   FLATPAK_GPG_PASSPHRASE  that key's passphrase, required alongside it
#   FLATPAK_HOMEPAGE     the project page named in the ref file
#   FLATPAK_BUNDLE_DIR   also pack each architecture as a single-file
#                        money-manager-<version>-<arch>.flatpak into this directory
#   FLATPAK_BUNDLE_VERSION  the version in that name, required alongside it
